    <p>
      We should be a Multitasking Master for today‚Äôs busy life.
      While we cannot do anything about how fast the time flows, we still can control how we manage it. Being more productive helps us to live full capacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even when we work with several applications, there are many small actions that may affect our time management. Time is much more valuable for us to spend it in switching among apps!
    </p>
    <p>
      Imagine you need to take note on Google Keep Notes while you are in an online meeting of Zoom. For this purpose, you have to do 8 or even more Steps!
      1Ô∏è‚É£ To switch in to Keep Note you should close Zoom,
      2Ô∏è‚É£ Back to the App Drawer
      3Ô∏è‚É£ or Home Screen
      4Ô∏è‚É£ Find Keep Note among many applications.
      5Ô∏è‚É£ Click for opening and taking note
      6Ô∏è‚É£ Then close note taking
      7Ô∏è‚É£ After that you can come back to Zoom!
      8Ô∏è‚É£ Oops! You Should take another note! OMG! Repeating this path again & again is too waste of the golden time! üò§ üò¥
    </p>
    <p>
      You do these actions many times per day with different applications without releasing how much time you are wasting.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‚ö†Ô∏è Google Translate should translate a word while reading an article. checking the monthly bill need a calculator application at the same time and ‚Ä¶ . Do you have any solution to save these times?
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortcuts are created for this purpose, but they are not enough to rescue the times. You only see them on the home page. They make the screen crowded and unorganized. Also, you still have to make several actions to switch among apps.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a great solution for these problems. Having shortcuts of applications floating...!
    </p>
    <p>
      ‚ö†Ô∏è Can you chat on WhatsApp, search on Google and prepare work report in Office Word simultaneously? No. Of Course Not!
